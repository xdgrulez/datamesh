Data Mesh in Practice Open Source Book

## Introduction

This is my first "Open Source Book" - a collaborative effort to come up with a book explaining how Zhamak Dehghani's *Data Mesh* can be put to use - both organizationally, and technically. While Zhamak is going to release her book titled *Data Mesh* with O'Reilly at the end of 2021/beginning of 2022, our aim is to finish ours only shortly after to augment Zhamak's book with a more practically-oriented companion.

*Practically* is supposed to mean both *technically*, i.e., how Zhamak's Data Mesh principles can be implemented with software, but even more so, *organizationally*. We think that Data Mesh has so far often been slightly misunderstood as a more technical, architectural concept just confined to the analytics space, but for us, the *organizational consequences* advocated by Zhamak also *beyond the analytics* space are even more important and powerful.

We see Data Mesh as a continuation of the fundamental business concept described originally by Alfred P. Sloan in his 1964 Doubleday book *My Time With General Motors*: *decentralization with co-ordinated control*. In the software world, the same idea has been taken about numerous times, most notably in Eric Evan's 2003 book *Domain-Driven Design* and Sam Newman's 2015 book *Building Microservices*.

## Format

We have decided to use Markdown as our markup language for writing the book for simplicity and to make the entrance barrier for new writers as low as possible.
