# Data Mesh and Beyond - Part 1: The Great Divide

This is a series of four blogs about and beyond one of the biggest hypes of 2021, a seemingly innocent set of principles called "Data Mesh" coming, like "Microservices", out of the innovative forge of ideas at Thoughtworks. Data Mesh was introduced by Zhamak Dehghani in a blog post (https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html) in 2019.

In the course of this series of blogs, we wish to convince you that Data Mesh is and will be the most disruptive of all disruptive "trends" of the last ten years, and even more so if you take it and think and go beyond. Then, Data Mesh is, for us, more disruptive than IoT, more disruptive than Cloud, and more disruptive than AI. Why? Because Data Mesh is not primarily about technology. It is not only about to impact the technology required in bringing about the often much longed for "Digital Transformation" - it is going to impact and change entire organizations from the ground up.

These four blogs provide answers to all of the big three "W" questions, respectively: "Why", "What", and "How". This first blog is about "Why" the set of principles comprising "Data Mesh" are so badly needed to fix the "Digital Transformation" of all those thousands of companies where it is not going into the right direction.

## Business Organization is Decentralized

In the business world, decentralization is key to achieve economies of scale, and a well established cure to avoid diseconomies of scale. When Alfred P. Sloan took the position of CEO of General Motors (GM) in 1923, his secret sauce to push GM ahead of the leading American car manufacturer at the time, Ford, a corporation fundamentally centrally organized, was what he called "decentralization with co-ordination". In Sloan's GM, each division operated like an autonomous body (=decentralization), yet each division was answerable to a central authority (=co-ordination). The result of that, under Sloan's chairmanship, GM overtook Ford only eight years later in 1931, and increased its share of the US automotive market from 12.7% to 47.5% (https://www.pioneeringminds.com/alfred-sloan-organizing-corporation/).

Fast forward to today to read anything from leading business consultancies such as McKinsey, and you can be sure that decentralization is almost always the guiding principle to organize businesses - only given up for centralization if really necessary to gain the effects of synergy, e.g. in the areas of purchasing, legal or human resources. In the blog "To centralize or not to centralize?" from the McKinsey Quarterly (June 2011, https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/to-centralize-or-not-to-centralize), the authors conclude that a decision to centralize requires a yes to at least one of three questions ![Three questions from the "To centralize or not to centralize" McKinsey blog]("pix/McKinsey_Decentralization_3_Questions.jpg")

## Digital Organizations are Centralized

When we, however, turn our gaze towards corporations partaking in what is often called "Digital Transformation", a completely different picture emerges. Here, *centralization* is adopted as the guiding principle of organization. Not only do these "digitally transforming" companies simply add centralized "digital organizations" to implement anything digital, but in addition, *data* is also centralized whenever possible in so-called data warehouses, data lakes, or lakehouses.

Companies like Snowflake, Databricks, and also Fivetran are incredibly successful in convincing executives of leading corporations of their idea of centralizing data. And because especially larger corporations are mostly already used to having an already existing large centralized department called "IT", the idea of simply also centralizing data, like IT, sticks easily and quickly.

## The Great Divide between Business Organization and Digital Organization

Hence, the same executives who are naturally embracing the lessons of Mr. Sloan and the McKinseys and live in a company composed of *decentralized* business domains, those same executives seem to be completely oblivious to the fact that they are, at the same time, accepting a practice of *centralizing* their digital organizations and also their data. What a contradiction!

What happens when companies take up this idea of centralizing not only IT, but also data, is often just an overly expensive mess.
