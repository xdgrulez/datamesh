# The State of Data Architecture

Bill Inmon is said to have already coined the term "Data Warehouse" in the 1970s - he is hence often called the "father of the Data Warehouse". His book "Building the Data Warehouse", first published in 1992, and the book "The Data Warehouse Toolkit" by Ralph Kimball, first published in 1996, still define much of the data architecture that can be observed today. The emergence of Big Data in the 2000s and 2010s has only partly changed data architecture.

Interestingly, even the appearance of the internet and Big Data  have not really challenged Inmon's...

Today's data architecture is 
Focusing on how data organizations remain the last bastions of fully monolithic, hypeerspcialized silos. We will talk about the obvious shortcomings of these models in the face of evolving needs of today. We will evaluate emergent data architecture blueprints and attempt to harmonize this with the notion of the data mesh and provide an opinion on how/where these intersect.
