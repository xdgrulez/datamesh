Organization/Software Architecture -> What should rather be centralized and what can be decentralized

choreography/orchestration

What does digital/agile transformation mean?
Key: The only way to unlock/enable agility is modularization = decentralization
The aim must be to make your organization as decentralized as possible

Yes, decentralized, but there also needs to be a way to re-connect the organization/share information

decentralization/decoupling in microservices:

+ services
+ deployment
+ development
+ databases
+ testing
+ security

- monitoring
- testing
- security

Conway's Law (1967)

"Any organization that designs a system (broadly defined) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure."

(1968 National Symposium on Modular Programming)

Yourdon/Constantine 1979: Structured Design

"The structure of any system designed by an organization is isomorphic to the structure of the organization."

Coplien/Harrison 2004: Organizational Patterns of Agile Software Development

"If the parts of an organization (e.g. team departments, or subdivisions) do not closely reflect the essential parts of the product, or if the relationships between organizations do not reflect the relationships between product parts, then the project will be trouble. Therefore: Make sure the organization is compatible with the product architecture."
